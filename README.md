### Edge Simulation Client
A basic simulation client which mimics the data of an edge device typically installed at a manufactoring plant
and collecting data through different machine and sensors. The simulation unit does not deal with plc or connection
level details of simulated machines in the plant, but just mimmics the data as if it is coming from various machines
in a single manufactoring plant.
